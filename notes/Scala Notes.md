## Local Functions
Local functions are the functions defined inside other functions. Therefore , local functions can access the parameters of their enclosing function.
## First-class Functions
Scala supports first-class functions which can be user defined as well as anonymous literal value, for example
```scala
(x:Int) => x + 1
```
parameters and the function body separated by the "=>". In case if the type can be inference, then no need to define type, this is called **target typing**.
